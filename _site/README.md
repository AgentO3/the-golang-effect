The Golang Effect
=================

How Go Shaped Operations at VividCortex

As an early stage startup you need to move fast. It’s important to carefully consider what programming languages you use, tools you adopt, and processes you establish. When we founded VividCortex we evaluated a number of languages and tools to build our services on. We could have picked languages like Java, C++, Scala, or Clojure, but we chose Go (Golang) because it compiles fast, it’s performant, it’s easy to deploy, and easy & fun for developers to learn, in a nutshell it helps us move fast. We also use a "chatops" set of tools and processes to configure, deploy and manipulate our environment: Jenkins, Ansible, and Hubot among others. It’s interesting to see how Go's characteristics work together with this modern stack, and how the combination has affected our company culture. In this talk we will discuss how we chose our tools, and how the decisions affected our organization as a whole, by inspiring us to adopt tools and processes that are easy to learn, administer, and help us move fast.
